## Software and device

Terbinari operating program represents interactive training and conversation model, natural language processing, understanding and generation syntactic and semantic analysis/matching logic algorithms, and controller operating methods.

Artificial conversational entity performs input/output question-answering, learning, spoken dialog system with multi-function chat-bot interface and anthropomorphic humanoid robot Control Bot Mechanism animatronics operator. The cervical motility device implements mouth speech events motion and eyes/head tracking contact and response under facial detection/recognition process of computer vision.

The bot operates individual unique memory content updated by interlocutor input in frames of the system legal code. The answer defines output for dialogue as a tool of reflective analysis by returning efferent recall from human-like machine cognitive function. Embodies autonomous companion simulator as trainable virtual teaching assistant and agent of compensatory intercourse for various interactive communication tasks.

## NLP semantic analysis methods algorithms

The operated choice between methods occurs at the level of input processing or mode condition and enters into interconnected work under functions control interface. 

### Direct answer chain

The simple and rigidly logical method represents automatic direct question-answer exchange learning and dialog process where the basic principle is output the answer to the question if the answer exists or request the answer to the new question. 

    q1a. q1b. q1c…
    a1a. a1b. a1c...
    q2a. q2b. q2c…
    a2a. a2b. a2c...

To start training and conversation open input window and insert:

    user: how are you? 
    _bot: fine, and you?
    user: perfect
    _bot: what is "perfect"?

  Request indicates that the answer does not exist.
 
    user: just perfect
    _bot: your answer "just perfect" saved 

  Compound of answer to the question saved: 

    user: Perfect
    _bot: Just perfect

  Using ending mark for multiple answer: 

    _bot: what is "perfect"?
    user: just perfect. it is perfect. you are perfect. yes, perfect
    
    user: perfect
    _bot: you are perfect
    user: perfect
    _bot: it is perfect
  
   Getting of new answer to exist question requires asking to request for a new adding to answer/multi-answer for question:   

    user: ask
    _bot: I want to know, how to answer to the question "hello"
    user: hi. whats up. hello. hey
    _bot: if you ask "hello" I answer "hi"

### Definition answer

Returns the answer to the subject with definition about the subject by determination of noun with basic question form: 

    user: true (DAC)
    _bot: true is true       
    user: what is true? (DA)
    _bot: true is condition

### Inverse definition answer

Returns attitude to the subject by inversion of pronoun and adjective content:

    user: What is your favorite color? 
    _bot: My favorite color is green    
    
### Contextual question
 
Answer with link to previous answer context by exist conjunction:

    user: who are you
    _bot: I am your friend              
    user: why?
    _bot: because I like you  
    
### Contextual answer

Provides adding and request method to create and return contextual dialogue node. Adding keyword "ctx" to question opens contextual answer creation sequence:

    user: how to teach "ctx"
    _bot: what to teach?              
    user: answers to questions
    _bot: how to teach?     
    user: insert questions. insert answers
    _bot: why to teach?   
    user: to teach me. to get conversation 

    user: how to teach?
    _bot: Insert answers
    user: what answers?
    _bot: answers to questions

### Vertical stair answer 

Mode-dependent stochastic optimization, including borrowed functions from other methods, and processing with several types of output in case of the "no answer" condition and adding of the new compound is not available. Processing flows by the stair of conditions with incipient step, which counts subject value and looks for containing answers with the context in the compound, while a move to the terminal noun value, otherwise the “answer not found” condition becomes true.

### Output appeal

Outputs questions and answers from existing memory assigned list or random/contextual choice.  

    _bot: mercury temperature is 801 fahrenheit

### Inference root algorithm

Returns the meaning curve of the word or sentence by weighing noun links in the whole memory context. 

## Commands and functions control

### Modes
                            
- TT (Text to Text) Learning mode
- TV (Text to Voice) Test mode
- VV (Voice to Voice) Conversation mode
- EX (Voice to Voice) Waiting submode

### Commands

To start conversation and training dialog, request your answer. 

✔️ Note: Use dot to split input into multi-answer/question insert. 

#### Modes

- chat >> Switch Chat Modes. TT/TV
- speak >> On/Off Voice Mode. TV/VV

✔️ Note: Make sure that your system audio input is of good quality to avoid speech recognition failures.

#### Conversation commands

- tet >> Attention. TT/TV/VV
- yes >> Confirmation to accept condition. TT/TV/VV
- no >> Confirmation to cancel condition. TT/TV/VV
- stop >> Stop conversation. Exit back from 'continue'. TV/VV/EX
- again >> Repeat phrase. TV/VV
- wait >> Pause speech. VV/EX
- continue >> Continue speech. VV/EX
- stop and continue >> Exit back from 'wait'. VV/EX

#### Dialog keys

- what is (noun definition)
- you, your, I, my (inverse definition of subject)
- why (contextual answer to previous sentence)
- what, why, how (contextual node)

#### Memory update

- ctx >> To add context answer. TT/TV
- ask >> To get request for answer. TT/TV

#### Memory edit

- format >> Format Memory. TT/TV
- remove >> Remove last compound. TT/TV
- delete >> Delete current compound. TT/TV

👉 Save and upload memory file backup to avoid loss of your original content in case of unexpected shut down or runtime error. Since storing of memory executes with completing of session, this will cause memory reset with default content.

#### Requests

- en/fr/ru >> to switch language input language code. TT/TV/VV
- time >> Time and date. TT/TV/VV
- information >> Information about. TT/TV/VV
- exit >> To close program with command and condition. TT/TV/VV

#### Scenario

- how old are you >> Age. TT/TV/VV
- what is your name >> Acquaintance. TT/TV/VV
- my name >>  User name. TT/TV/VV

#### Tools

- numb +-/* numb >> Request for math calculations. TT/TV/VV
- filter >> On/Off Spelling correction filter. TT/TV

#### Vision

- vision >> Vision mode. Vision On/Off. TV/VV

✔️ Note: To assign command for a new request, add access key (c1) in your answer.

- hi and see >> Keywords to get face recognition response. TT/TV/VV
- clear >> Delete recognition data. TT/TV/VV

👉 Panel allows you to choose video device and track computer vision.
